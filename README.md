# Shark-Attacks-Aus-Analysis
Tools: Tableau

Analysed historical shark attack data in Australia from 1791 to 2024 to uncover trends and insights, focusing on vulnerable groups, species involved, safety distances and effective escape strategies. Designed and developed an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize findings and provide practical advice for ocean safety.
Key Results: Male individuals and those aged 10â€“30 are most at risk, White sharks are responsible for the majority of attacks, Bull sharks attack closest to shore at an average distance of 20 meters, larger sharks are linked to more severe injuries, coastal areas are the most common locations for attacks, summer months show the highest incident rates, using diversions such as spearguns or paddles significantly improves escape success.
